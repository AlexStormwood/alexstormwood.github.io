## Belated Blogging

Yes, these blog posts are coming months after the trip has been and gone.

This was my first overseas solo trip and as incredible as it was, I definitely planned to do too much.

Originally, I was going to write these posts during the holiday - but I became so tired so quickly that this shot to the bottom of my priorities & tasks. It's taken a while for writing to bubble back up.

The trip was awesome and I'm keen to go back for more, and I definitely want to make sure my experiences and photos are stored somewhere nice for posterity. 

So, hang tight - more posts are coming! 


## Flight: Sydney to Haneda

Overnight flight to try and get a jump on the holiday. Not sure that it's worth it - it's rough to sleep on a plane. It's rough to sleep on a plane built for a smaller (average) person. I am tall and mildly obese - economy seats are not good for me. 

ANA food was nice though - dinner was a katsu curry with various small sides, drink, and vanilla gelato for desert. The staff were all great and kind, too.

So, this trip was happening just after the new year celebrations and Japanese hatsumode tradition, so flights were not cheap. I bought a bundle - Sydney to Tokyo, Sapporo to Tokyo, Tokyo to Sydney - and it was roughly $3000 AUD. 

Pushing the trip back a week or two would've been about a grand cheaper, but the timing of the trip that I chose was simpler with regards to time off from work. This timing also guaranteed some snow sights, even if the snowy area was just Sapporo at the end of the trip! 

Arriving at Haneda was good, though it was impacted by [the two-plane collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Haneda_Airport_runway_collision) that occured earlier in the week. And by "impacted", I just mean that we arrived at a different terminal. The airport operations were smooth, you would have no clue that anything had happened if you don't keep up with any news.

Arriving at Haneda terminal 2 was great, because it made it easier to find one of the rare Pokemon merchandise vending machines. I found one and managed to grab a Pikachu plushie dressed as a Haneda plane pilot. The vending machine was nifty - you select your product, pay for it, and then it does a fun li'l song & dance while it places the products into a paper bag, to eventually dispense the gift bag to you.

I had shipped off my suitcases through a luggage forwarding company at the airport, so I was able to start exploring ASAP without dragging suitcases everywhere. $25 AUD to send one suitcase to my hotel, to arrive the next day. Apparently, if I had gone to terminal 3, the luggage forwarding companies there would've delivered on the same day because this was all happening around 5:30am-6:00am. But either way, I was able to hand off my luggage.

Keeping a change of clothing in the day-bag meant this was no problem, and allowed me to start being a tourist at the bright and early hour of 6am, Tokyo time.


## Tokyo Skytree

My first tourist destination in Tokyo was the Tokyo Skytree. After a quick bus between Haneda airport terminals and buying a Welcome Suica card to use the transport system, I was able to just catch a train from Haneda directly to the Skytree shopping centre.

This was all happening on a Friday, and as the train trip went on for almost an hour, the workday commuters started piling up. 

Tokyo is built to manage high capacities of commuters, so this wasn't an issue. There are many more people going about their day in Tokyo compared to Sydney, Australia, and yet it felt like the crowds were never thicker or slower than anything I've experienced in Sydney.
